		<p style="margin-right:30px;margin-left:30px;">In 1981, seven musicians started MusicHub Limited with just
			US$250. From the beginning, the company was founded on the principle
			of building and implementing great ideas that drive progress for
			clients and enhance lives through enterprise solutions. For over
			three decades, we have been a company focused on bringing to life
			great ideas and enterprise solutions that drive progress for our
			clients. We recognize the importance of nurturing relationships that
			reflect our culture of unwavering ethics and mutual respect. It will
			come as no surprise, then, that 98.8 percent (Q1 FY 17) of our
			revenues come from existing clients. MusicHub has a growing global
			presence with more than 197,000+ employees. Globally, we have 85
			sales and marketing offices and 114 development centers as at March
			31, 2016. At MusicHub, we believe our responsibilities extend beyond
			business. That is why we established the Music Match Foundation to
			provide assistance to some of the more socially and economically
			depressed sectors of the communities in which we work. And that is
			why we behave ethically and honestly in all our interactions with our
			clients, our partners and our employees.</p>
